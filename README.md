# AutoSpeaker

AutoSpeaker uses a combination of Auto-Correlation and noise cancelling techniques to minimize room noise and adjust the music volume based on the atmosphere in the room. The goal of this team is to design and build both the hardware and software portions of this project to make the Autospeaker an easy addition to any room’s sound system.

Equipped with its own speaker, auxiliary cables, and bluetooth capabilities, the Autospeaker will be able to connect to any speaker system in the room that it monitors. The processing will be done via software in an on-board Arduino chip. The goal of this team is to design and build both the hardware and software portions of this project to make the Autospeaker an easy addition to any room’s sound system.
